* __Object-Oriented Programming, (OOP)__ is a programming paradigm that is based on the idea of organizing code into "objects," which are instances of classes. In Python, OOP is a fundamental feature and is used to model and solve problems in a more organized and modular way 🥤.

* __In object-oriented programming in Python, objects are representations of real-world entities or abstract concepts.__ Each object has properties (called attributes) and behaviors (called methods). Classes are the blueprints or templates that define the structure and behavior of objects. Objects are created from these classes💪.
